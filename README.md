# Host Enumeration Scripts
Lots of wonderful and extremely helpful scripts/projects/repo's exist on GitHub for host enumeration. This repo combines all Host Enumeration Scripts (HES) I found helpful during my OSCP studies in one location.

Some of them are original versions, while some have been updated.

## Linux
* linux/LinEnum.sh - See original page for usage information: https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum.
* linux/PE.sh - Original page: https://github.com/WazeHell/PE-Linux.
* linux/linuxprivchecker-py2.py - This is an updated version of the original linuxprivchecker.py script by sh1n0b1. Original can be found here: https://gist.github.com/sh1n0b1/e2e1a5f63fbec3706123
* linux/linuxprivchecker-py3.py - Same as above, but works with Python 3.

## Windows
windows/enum.sh - This is a ghetto script I created to help automate enumeration. It has accesschk and mimikatz dependencies so read the code to understand what is needed.
