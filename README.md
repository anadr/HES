# Host Enumeration Scripts
Lots of wonderful and extremely helpful scripts/projects/repo's exist on GitHub for host enumeration. This repo combines all Host Enumeration Scripts (HES) I found helpful during my OSCP studies in one location.

Some of them are original versions, while some have been updated.
